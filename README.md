# 🎬 AgencyDB  
## Production & Talent Management Database (Website Query Project)

AgencyDB is a relational database system designed to support the operations of a **media and talent agency**.  
The database manages **personnel, performers, productions, schedules, rental venues, partners, and expenses**, and provides a collection of **practical SQL queries** that simulate real-world website/database usage.



## 📌 Project Scope & Purpose

The goal of this project is to design a database that can answer common operational questions for an agency, such as:

- Which actors or crew members are available at a given time?
- Which rental places are currently in use?
- Which productions have the highest expenses?
- Who are the most active actors?
- What upcoming schedules are planned?
